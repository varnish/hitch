# Configuring Hitch

Hitch can be configured either from command line arguments or from a
configuration file on disk.

You can extract the usage description by invoking Hitch with the "--help"
argument. An example configuration file is included in the distribution.

In general Hitch is a protocol agnostic proxy and does not need much configuration.

List of configuration items to consider:

  - PEM files with key and certificate.
  - Listening addresses and ports. Note the semi-odd square brackets for IPv4 addresses.
  - Which backend servers to proxy towards, and if PROXY protocol should be used.
  - Number of workers, usually 1. For larger setups, use one worker per core.

If you need to support legacy clients, you can consider:

  - Enable SSLv3 with "--ssl" (despite RFC7568.)
  - Use weaker ciphers.

## Specifying ciphers

The recommended default is:

    "EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH"

If you need to support legacy clients, consider the "HIGH" cipher group.

Hitch cipher list string format is identical to that of other servers, so you can use
tools like https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/ to generate a set of ciphers that suits your needs.

Normally you do not have to change this.

## Using multiple certificates

To add multiple certificates to the hitch config, simply specify multiple ``pem-file``
lines like so:

    pem-file = "/etc/tls/first-combined.pem"
    pem-file = "/etc/tls/second-combined.pem"

## Run environment

If you're handling a large number of connections, you'll probably want to raise
`ulimit -n` before running Hitch.

If you are listening to ports under 1024 (443 comes to mind), you need
to start Hitch as root. In those cases you *must* use --user/-u to set
a non-privileged user `hitch` can setuid() to.
If you are aware of the security implications and insist on running the worker
threads as root too, both the user and the group must be set to root.


## Preparing PEM files

PEM files should contain the key file, the certificate from the CA and any
intermediate CAs needed.

    $ cat example.com.key example.com.crt intermediate.pem > example.com.pem

If you want to use Diffie-Hellman based ciphers for Perfect Forward Secrecy
(PFS), you need to add some parameters for that as well:

    $ openssl dhparam -rand - 2048 >> example.com.pem

Hitch will complain and disable DH unless these parameters are available.

## Automatic OCSP staple retrieval

Hitch has support for automated retrieval of OCSP responses from an
OCSP responder.

If the loaded certificate contains an OCSP responder address and it
also has the required issuer certificate as part of its chain, Hitch
will automatically retrieve and refresh OCSP staples.

The `ocsp-dir` directory must be read/write accessible by the
configured hitch user, and should not be read or write accessible by
any other user.

The staples are fetched asynchronously, and will be loaded and ready
for stapling as soon as they are available.

The variables ``ocsp-connect-tmo`` and ``ocsp-resp-tmo`` controls
respectively the connect timeout and fetch transmission timeout when
Hitch is talking to an OCSP responder.

Automated OCSP stapling can be disabled by specifying an empty string
for the `ocsp-dir` parameter:

	ocsp-dir = ""


## Verification of OCSP staples

Hitch will optionally verify the OCSP staple, this can be done by
specifying

	ocsp-verify-staple = on

in the configuration file.

If you are running with a custom CA, the verification certificates can
be changed by setting the `SSL_CERT_FILE` or `SSL_CERT_DIR`
environment variables. `SSL_CERT_FILE` can point to a single pem file
containing a chain of certificates, while the `SSL_CERT_DIR` can be a
comma-separated list of directories containing pem file with symlinks
by their hash key (see the man page of c_rehash from the OpenSSL
library for more information).



## OCSP stapling from manually pre-loaded files

Hitch also has support for stapling of OCSP responses loaded from
files on disk. If configured, Hitch will include a stapled OCSP
response as part of the handshake when it receives a status request
from a client.

Retrieving an OCSP response suitable for use with Hitch can be done
using the following `openssl` command:

    $ openssl ocsp \
        -url https://ocsp.example.com \
        -header Host ocsp.example.com \
        -no_nonce \
        -resp_text \
        -issuer issuer.pem \
        -cert mycert.pem \
        -respout ocspresp.der

This will produce a DER-encoded OCSP response which can then be loaded
by Hitch.

The URL of the OCSP responder can be retrieved via

	$ openssl x509 -ocsp_uri -in mycert.pem -noout

the `-issuer` argument needs to point to the OCSP issuer
certificate. Typically this is the same certificate as the
intermediate that signed the server certificate.

To configure Hitch to use the OCSP staple, use the following
incantation when specifying the `pem-file` setting in your Hitch
configuration file:

    pem-file = {
        cert = "mycert.pem"
        ocsp-resp-file = "mycert-ocsp.der"
    }


## ALPN/NPN support

Hitch supports both the ALPN and the NPN TLS extension. This allows
negotiation of the application layer protocol that is to be used.

This is useful if Hitch terminates TLS for HTTP/2 traffic.

To turn this on, you must supply an `alpn-protos` setting in the
configuration file:

	alpn-protos = "h2,http/1.1"

If the PROXY protocol is enabled (`write-proxy = on`), Hitch will
transmit the selected protocol as part of its PROXY header.


## SSL/TLS protocol setting

Hitch supports TLS (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) and SSL 3. By default, only
TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3 are enabled, while the older protocol
versions are disabled. The recommended way to to select protocols is
to use `tls-protos` in the configuration file:

    tls-protos = TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3

The following tokens are available for the `tls-protos` option:
`SSLv3`, `TLSv1.0`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2` and `TLSv1.3`.

The availability of protocol versions depend on OpenSSL version and
system configuration. In particular for TLS 1.3, openssl 1.1.1 or
later is required.

For supporting legacy protocol versions you may also need to lower the
`MinProtocol` property in your OpenSSL configuration (typically
`/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf`).

## TCP Fast Open Support

TCP Fast Open saves up to one full round-trip time (RTT) over 
the standard three-way connection handshake during a TCP session.

On a system which supports TCP Fast Open, Hitch is able to reduce 
network latency with the following in the configuration file:

    tcp-fastopen = on

## Uninterrupted configuration reload

Issuing a SIGHUP signal to the main Hitch process will initiate a
reload of Hitch's configuration file.

Adding, updating and removing PEM files (``pem-file``) and frontend
listen endpoints (``frontend``) is currently supported.

Hitch will load the new configuration in its main process, and spawn a
new set of child processes with the new configuration in place if
successful.

The previous set of child processes will finish their handling of any
live connections, and exit after they are done.

If the new configuration fails to load, an error message will be
written to syslog. Operation will continue without interruption with
the current set of worker processes.
