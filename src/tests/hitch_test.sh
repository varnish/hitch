# export TESTDIR=`pwd`/; export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/../:`pwd`/../util/

# We want the shell to catch errors for us and fail as soon as a command
# fails or an undefined variable is used (often typos for the latter).

# currently done when an explicit failure triggers, and could leave us in the
# dark if we a "naked" command fails and is caught by `set -e`. We can wrap
# any command with the `run_cmd` helper to trigger a failure.
