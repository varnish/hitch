.Op Fl e Ar engine
.Op Fl b Ar host,port
.Op Fl f Ar host,port
.Op Fl n Ar cores

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a network proxy that terminates TLS/SSL connections and forwards the
unencrypted traffic to some backend.  It's designed to handle 10s of thousands of
connections efficiently on multicore machines.
.Pp
.Nm
has very few features -- it's designed to be paired with an intelligent
backend like haproxy or nginx.  It maintains a strict 1:1 connection pattern
with this backend handler so that the backend can dictate throttling behavior,
maxmium connection behavior, availability of service, etc.
.Pp
The only required argument is a path to a PEM file that contains the certificate
(or a chain of certificates) and private key. It should also contain
DH parameter if you wish to use Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -tls
Use TLSv1 (default).
.It Fl -ssl
Use only SSLv3 and no TLSv1.
.It Fl c Ar ciphers
Set allowed ciphers using the same format as
.Ic openssl ciphers .
For example, you can use
.Ar RSA:!COMPLEMENTOFALL .
.It Fl e Ar engine
Specify an OpenSSL engine by its unique ID. The engine will be used by
default for all algorithms.  The keyword
.Ar auto
can be used to load all available engines.
.It Fl b Ar host,port
Define backend. Default is
.Ar 127.0.0.1,8000 .
Incoming connections will be unwrapped and sent to this IP and port.
.It Fl f Ar host,port
Define frontend. Default is
.Ar *,8443 .
Incoming connections will be accepted to this IP and port and will be
sent to the backend defined above.
.It Fl n Ar cores
Use
.Ar cores
worker processes. Default is 1.
.It Fl B Ar backlog
Set listen backlog size. Default is 100.
.It Fl C Ar cache
Set shared cache size in sessions. By default, no shared cache is used.
.It Fl r Ar path
Chroot to the given path. By default, no chroot is done.
.It Fl u Ar username
Set GID/UID after binding the socket. By default, no privilege is dropped.
.It Fl q
Be quiet. Only emit error messages.
.It Fl s
Send messages to syslog in addition to
.Em stderr
and
.Em stdout .
.It Fl -syslog-facility Ar facility
Syslog facility to use. Default is
.Ar daemon .
.It Fl -write-ip
Write 1 octet with the IP family followed by the IP address in 4
(IPv4) or 16 (IPv6) octets little-endian to backend before the actual
data.
.It Fl -write-proxy
Write HaProxy's PROXY (IPv4 or IPv6) protocol line
before actual data.

was originally written by Jamie Turner (@jamwt) and is maintained by
the Bump server team.  It currently provides server-side TLS
termination for over 40 million Bump users.
